    <p>Hello,</p>

    <p>We started this journey wanting to change the way we communicate with machines and, in the process, we believe we have changed the way brands communicate with customers, the way publishers communicate with readers, and, in general, the way users communicate with our clients. Our natural language processing engine scans, understands, and learns from millions of pages of content, few billion words, billions of characters, and many many hours of training in order to provide value to our clients.</p>

    <p>Some of our recent work includes,</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.adlite.co.uk">Adlite</a> delivers content intelligence to publishers and advertisers. For publishers, Adlite finds the content that may appeal the most to advertisers so publishers make sure they sell their inventory at the right price. Using Gixante’s natural language engine, publishers are able to get more value from their existing assets, whilst providing more engagement for their users by aligning relevant advertising to relevant content. For advertisers, Adlite finds placements that make their campaigns perform at their best. Adlite scans content from advertisers' websites and returns the placements within publishers' inventory that optimise the impact of their ads, for record levels of engagement. Adlite makes advertisers connect with their audience as they read content that is directly related to advertisers’ content, values and believes.</p>

    <p>To provide competitive intelligence, <a href="http://www.adthena.com">Adthena</a> receives 150 million search keywords, analytics and advertisements per day. Making sense of this wealth of information is a challenge even for skilled advertisers. Gixante's Natural Language interface adds a layer of human-like understanding to this content at scale, allowing for instance to quickly aggregate data and see what type of messaging works best across any brand or campaign. And because our predictive models understand free text, they can fill in the gaps and find new opportunities without lengthy and expensive tests.</p>

    <p>Gixante is working with <a href="http://www.just-eat.co.uk">Just Eat</a> to find your flavour in a natural and fluid way, no matter where you are or how you ask for it. We are very excited to apply our Natural Language layer to transform the on demand food industry!</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>If you would like to schedule a meeting, get more information or leave some feedback, drop us a message and we will be in touch.</p>
